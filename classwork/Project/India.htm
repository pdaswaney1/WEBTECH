    Rubeina Karachiwalla is the founder of Ruby’s Organics: India’s first organic makeup line. Ruby’s Organics
    aims
    to
    turn makeup into value added skin-care through the use of natural and organically sourced ingredients. Read
    on to
    find out more about Rubeina and Ruby’s Organics:
  </p>

  <h2>Why did you start Ruby’s Organics?</h2>
  <p id="ruby">Ever since I was a teenager, I have been fascinated with the beauty industry. At the age of 25, I
    quit
    my job and decided to take a certified makeup course. Other than the application techniques, I learned
    everything
    there was to know about makeup from formulations, chemicals, etc. When I started reading and researching more
    about
    the industry, I was surprised by the various toxic chemicals many of our daily beauty products contained. I
    started
    experimenting in my kitchen by ordering raw materials from eBay and making “natural” beauty products with my
    grinder. I noticed that when I was using these natural products, my skin just felt and looked healthier. I
    continued to fine tune my beauty recipes and finally received the license to manufacture my products in
    India,
    now
    known as Ruby’s Organics. I developed Ruby’s Organics as a healthier beauty company for the Indian women
    today.</p>

  <h2>Can you tell us about the products?</h2>
  <p id="ruby">I started by developing a basic line of products, such as eyeliner and lipstick, to first
    understand
    customer preferences. When I received a positive response, I developed a full range of cosmetics including
    eyeliners, mascaras, lipsticks, eyeshadows, highlighters, and concealers that even work as foundation. Our
    products
    are all formulated with naturally soured ingredients and are devoid of chemical preservatives. For example,
    our
    lipstick and concealers are a combination of seed butters, beeswax, oils, and pigments. Our products are made
    from
    natural minerals and pigmented with micas, allowing for makeup that is lightweight and nourishing for the
    skin.<p>

      <h2>How did you go about creating the formulas? What were the ingredients used instead of chemicals? </h2>
      <p id="ruby">As we created Ruby’s Organics, we started looking for natural alternatives to synthetic
        ingredients.
        We use beeswax instead of petroleum, and mica instead of silicas. Our products are formulated with a
        combination of mineral, organic, and natural ingredients. As a company we are 68% organic and 100%
        healthy.</p>

      <h2>Can you provide our readers with tips to responsibly for beauty products and chemicals they should
        refrain
        from?</h2>
      <p id="ruby">My biggest piece of advice is know what you are putting on your skin. Look through the
        ingredient
        list of your beauty products and do your research. It’s important to empower ourselves with the right
        information, so we can buy responsibly.I would recommend to refrain from any product that contains
        alcohol
        like
        ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, methanol, etc. They tend to dry out the skin causing irritation and leading
        to
        breakouts. Also avoid any petroleum based products. Petroleum jelly is an “occlusive” agent meaning it
        creates
        a barrier on the skin and suffocates the pores.
      </p>

      <h2>As a female entrepreneur in India, what were some of the challenges you faced?</h2>
      <p id="ruby"> There were way too many. I had not been funded, so I scraped through my savings and took a
        loan
        from my Dad to start this company. Initially, when Ruby’s Organics was just an idea, no one took me
        seriously
        as I was only 25-year-old female. When I was sourcing and contacting vendors from small town villages, no
        one
        understood this concept of an organic cosmetic line. My manufacturer also was refusing to accept that
        this
        would be a possibility. After three years of struggles and challenges, I finally built my brand and even
        received a FDA approval. </p>

      <h2>Where can consumers find Ruby’s Cosmetics and what are future plans of expansion? </h2>
      <p id="ruby">We mainly sell our products digitally through our website. However, our products can also be
        found
        on Nykaa, Amazon, and Scootsy. We have also tied up with local boutiques in cities around India (Bandra,
        Pondicherry, New Delhi, Calcutta, etc) that cater to this natural/organic market specifically.
        Our goal is to spend a little more time in India and eventually reach a point where we can diversify and
        sell
        internationally. For that we would need investors to get involved and would we would have to scale our
        business
        so that it is faster and better.</p>

      <p id="ruby">Rubeina is such an inspiration for female entrepreneaurs in India and we wish her all the best
        as
        she creates a mark in the natural beauty industry. Check out Ruby’s Organics here: <a href
