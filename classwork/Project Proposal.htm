<h1>Project Proposal<h1>

<h2>What is your website about?<h2>
<p> My website is a blog called Beauty Boss where I interview beauty entrepreneurs from around the world. The website will
    feature the stories of various entrepreneurs who have started their own businesses in beauty. 
</p>
<h2>What is the objective of your website? (Also read as why would this site be important?)<h2>
<p> Beauty Boss is a collective of beauty entrepreneurs; a platform to share their stories and experiences.  Beauty Boss will feature beauty entrepreneurs around the world through full length and mini interviews about their passions, businesses, 
    talents, and goals with the goal of bridging the gap between the lovers of the beauty industry and entrepreneurs within the field.<p> 
<h2>Who is your target audience set?<h2>
<p>My target audience are people who are highly passionate about the beauty industry and are looking to find inspiration and advice,  
    through browsing our archive of our Beauty Bosses.</p>
<h2>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?<h2>
<p>I have will have a home page, about me page, and a contact page. My About Me page will have a photo of me and just some basic background information of why I started the website. My contact page will have my email 
    address where beauty entrepreneurs can reach out to me. My main page called Beauty Bosses will feature interviews from a few beauty entrepreneurs from the US 
    and a couple from other countries from around the world.  The interview will be about 3-4 questions long, with a photo of the entrepreneur as well. <p>
